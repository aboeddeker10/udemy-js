//Number
//String
//Boolean - true/false
//Undefined - actual value taken by variable that is not yet defined (empty value)
//Null - empty value
//Symbol (es2015) - 
//BigInt - larger integers than the Number type can hold

//Dynamic typing - we do not have to manually define the data type, JS has it automatically (value has type, not variable)
